# Project3_Backend_Express
This project is a calendar, with appointment selecting api.
Users can click on and select a day on the calendar, which opens a modal containing times available/unavailable for said day.
When a user clicks on a time slot that is available it will open a second modal where the user will be required to fill out personal information such as name and email to schedule an appointment, but also includes a button to "select a new day and time" to revert back to calendar homepage.
The Backend uses express, mongoose, and cors.
This is a full CRUD app.
Information submitted from the front end will be stored in the database.
This information will be accessible and manipulatable through various onClicks on the frontend.
Excalidraw was utilized as a wireframe to map out app layout and determine steps in developing.
