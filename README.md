# Project3_Backend_Express
Introduction:
This was a group project for class (3 team members total) and we created an app utilizing React, Express, and MongoDB calendar. It is an appointment creating api for any type of business (we chose to do a tattoo shop business for display purposes).
Users can click on and select a day on the calendar, which opens a modal containing times available/unavailable for said day.
When a user clicks on a time slot that is available it will open a second modal where the user will be required to fill out personal information such as name and email to schedule an appointment, but also includes a button to "Select Different Day" to revert back to calendar homepage.
When a user fills out and submits the information it will render that time slot "unavailable" by greying it out.
Excalidraw was utilized as a wireframe to map out app layout and determine steps in developing.

Backend was deployed on Heroku with Atlas MongoDB

Stretch Goals/ Future State:
	-Incorporate or create an admin page to monitor and track appointments but also have full control to eliminate specific times or adjust appointments as needed.
	-Add Google Maps to provide a location for the business
	-Add additional "tattoo artists" or employees to schedule appointments
